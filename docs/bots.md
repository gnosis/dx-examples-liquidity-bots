# DutchX Bots
When we start the application, it will start also 3 bots.

Every bot is created with one goal, so once they are up, the will try to do
their jobs.

# Sell Liquidity Bot
This bot will make sure we meet the minimum liquidity required
by the smart contract for the auction to start.

In other words, it makes sure the auction starts automatically filling the
missing sell volume.

The smart contract won't start the auction, unless we have more than
`$1.000` worth of the sell token, so this bot fill the missing difference.

## When will this bot ensure the sell liquidity?
It will ensure it as soon as both of the opposite auctions clear for a token pair.

## Which of the two auctions it will fund?
It will fund the one with the highest funding, so it has to fill with less worth
of tokens.

# Buy Liquidity Bot
This bot will make sure the auction closes when we reach the market price.

If nobody bids when the auction is on the market price, the price will continue
to go down, and eventually, after 24h, could get to 0.

To avoid this situation, the buy bot will buy automatically when the token price
is at a right price.

## How does the bot know what is the market price?
Right now the buy bot can check in any of these exchanges:

* **Binance**: https://www.binance.com
* **Bitfinex**: https://www.bitfinex.com/
* **HitBTC**: https://hitbtc.com/
* **Huobi**: https://www.huobi.com
* **Kraken**: http://kraken.com
* **Liquid**: https://www.liquid.com/

Depending on the token pair, we can configure an strategy for getting the
market price.

If you consider that none of these exchanges fits to your needs you can make a
pull request and add a new one. Check here
[how to add a price feed](https://dutchx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bots-price-feed.html)


## Strategies for getting the price - Sequence
The current strategy implemented by the buy bot is called `sequence`, but more
strategies could be implemented for future versions.

For example, we could configure the bots with the following strategies:
```js
const EXCHANGE_PRICE_FEED_STRATEGIES_DEFAULT = {
  strategy: 'sequence',
  feeds: ['binance', 'huobi', 'kraken', 'bitfinex']
}

const EXCHANGE_PRICE_FEED_STRATEGIES = {
  'WETH-OMG': {
    strategy: 'sequence',
    feeds: ['binance', 'huobi', 'bitfinex']
  },
  'WETH-RDN': {
    strategy: 'sequence',
    feeds: ['huobi', 'binance', 'bitfinex']
  }
}
```

For the `sequence` strategy we can define a sorted list of the exchanges we want
to use for getting the price.

The buy bot will try to get the price from the first exchange, if it's down or
unresponsive, it will try to get the price from the second one, and so on.

The idea is to pick the order using first the most trusted exchanges, for
example we could use the trade volume to help us decide.

## Buy liquidity rules
Another important part of the buy liquidity bot, is the buy rules.

These rules allow the bot to decide how much they should buy, and in what
precise moment.

For example, we could define these rules:
* Ensure that **1/3 of the sell volume** is bought when the **price equals the
market price**.
* Ensure that **2/3 of the sell volume** is bought when the **price is 2% below
the market price**.
* Ensure that **the whole sell volume** is bought when the **price is 4% below
the market price**.

This rules can be specified using this configuration:

```js
const BUY_LIQUIDITY_RULES = [
  // Buy 1/3 if price equals market price
  {
    marketPriceRatio: {
      numerator: 1,
      denominator: 1
    },
    buyRatio: {
      numerator: 1,
      denominator: 3
    }
  },

  // Buy 2/3 if price falls below 98%
  {
    marketPriceRatio: {
      numerator: 98,
      denominator: 100
    },
    buyRatio: {
      numerator: 2,
      denominator: 3
    }
  },

  // Buy the 100% if price falls below 96%
  {
    marketPriceRatio: {
      numerator: 96,
      denominator: 100
    },
    buyRatio: {
      numerator: 1,
      denominator: 1
    }
  }
]
```

# CheckBalanceBot
The liquidity bots are very useful, but in order to operate, they need to have
enough tokens to perform the bids and asks, and also some Ether so they can
pay the gas costs for the transactions.

This bot will check periodically the balances for the bots and will show a
warning message when we are below the defined threshold.

> In the future, we will provide a way to send the notification using Slack or
> mail.

# Balance thresholds
For example, the rules could be, notify if we are below:
* `$5000` worth of any tokens
* `0.4 Ether`

So we would have this configuration:
```js
const MINIMUM_AMOUNT_IN_USD_FOR_TOKENS = 5000 // $5000
const MINIMUM_AMOUNT_FOR_ETHER = 0.4 * 1e18 // 0.4 Ether
````
